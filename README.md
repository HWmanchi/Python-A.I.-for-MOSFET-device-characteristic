# Python-A.I.-for-MOSFET-device characteristic simulation 
1. We use Python for MOSFET model building. Refer to https://github.com/tirthajyoti/Digital-Twin/blob/main/MOSFET-1.ipynb  (Digit twin concept)  
2. Advanced: You can use A.I. Machine Learning Algorithm to build the semiconductor device model,e.g. MOSFET, BJT, IGBT, p-n junction, diode, or photo-electron device.   
Here is shown the MOSFET model building.
