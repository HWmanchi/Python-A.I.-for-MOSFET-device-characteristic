# MOSFET_Digital-Twin 
We use Python for MOSFET model building. Refer to https://github.com/tirthajyoti/Digital-Twin/blob/main/MOSFET-1.ipynb 
You can use A.I. Machine Learning Algorithm (CNN,RNN, LSTM or et.al) to build the semiconductor device model,e.g. MOSFET, BJT, IGBT, p-n junction, diode, or photo-electron device, such as Si-based solar cell.
